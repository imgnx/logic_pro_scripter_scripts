# Logic Scripter Snippets

Small, focused Logic Pro Scripter scripts for MIDI utilities and performance tools.

**Contents**
- `ChordEnumerator.js` logs one chord label per bar based on the lowest note heard in that bar, along with pitch-class and interval details.
- `Tremolo.js` generates a length-sensitive note-repeater tail after note-off, with envelope, filtering, and pitch-decay controls.

**Usage**
1. Open Logic Pro and add the Scripter MIDI FX plugin to a track.
2. Paste the contents of the script you want into the Scripter editor.
3. Adjust the plugin parameters as needed and check the Trace console for output.

**Notes**
- These scripts are meant to be run directly in Logic Pro's Scripter environment.
- No build or test steps are required for this repository.
